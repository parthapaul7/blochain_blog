For all of its complexity, blockchain’s potential as a decentralized form of record keeping is almost without limit. From greater user privacy and heightened security to lower processing fees and fewer errors, blockchain technology may very well see applications beyond those outlined above. But there are also some disadvantages.

Transactions on the blockchain network are approved by a network of thousands of computers. This removes almost all human involvement in the verification process, resulting in less human error and an accurate record of information. Even if a computer on the network were to make a computational mistake, the error would only be made to one copy of the blockchain. For that error to spread to the rest of the blockchain, it would need to be made by at least 51% of the network’s computers—a near impossibility for a large and growing network the size of Bitcoin’s.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-39"><span>6</span></span>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-114" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">
Typically, consumers pay a bank to verify a transaction, a notary to sign a document, or a minister to perform a marriage. Blockchain eliminates the need for third-party verification—and, with it, their associated costs. For example, business owners incur a small fee whenever they accept payments using credit cards, because banks and payment-processing companies&nbsp;have to process those transactions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not have a central authority and has limited transaction fees.

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-117" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">
Blockchain does not store any of its information in a central location. Instead, the blockchain is copied and spread across a network of computers. Whenever a new block is added to the blockchain, every computer on the network updates its blockchain to reflect the change. By spreading that information across a network, rather than storing it in one central database, blockchain becomes more difficult to tamper with. If a copy of the blockchain fell into the hands of a hacker, only a single copy of the information, rather than the entire network, would be compromised.

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-120" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">
Transactions placed through a central authority can take up to a few days to settle. If you attempt to deposit a check on Friday evening, for example, you may not actually see funds in your account until Monday morning. Whereas financial institutions operate during business hours, usually five days a week, blockchain is working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year. Transactions can be completed in as little as 10 minutes and can be considered secure after just a few hours. This is particularly useful for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/09/currency-cross-triangulation.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">cross-border</a> trades, which usually take much longer because of time zone issues and the fact that all parties must confirm payment processing.

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-123" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">
Many blockchain networks operate as public databases, meaning that anyone with an Internet connection can view a list of the network’s transaction history. Although users can access details about transactions, they cannot access identifying information about the users making those transactions. It is a common misperception that blockchain networks like bitcoin are anonymous, when in fact they are only confidential.
</p>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-124" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></div>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-125" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">
When a user makes a public transaction, their unique code—called a public key, as mentioned earlier—is recorded on the blockchain. Their personal information is not. If a person has made a Bitcoin purchase on an exchange that requires identification, then the person’s identity is still linked to their blockchain address—but a transaction, even when tied to a person’s name, does not reveal any personal information.
</p>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-126" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></div>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-128" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">
Once a transaction is recorded, its authenticity must be verified by the blockchain network. Thousands of computers on the blockchain rush to confirm that the details of the purchase are correct. After a computer has validated the transaction, it is added to the blockchain block. Each block on the blockchain contains its own unique hash, along with the unique hash of the block before it. When the information on a block is edited in any way, that block’s hash code changes—however, the hash code on the block after it would not. This discrepancy makes it extremely difficult for information on the blockchain to be changed without notice.

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-131" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">
Most blockchains are entirely open-source software. This means that anyone and everyone can view its code. This gives auditors the ability to review cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for security. This also means that there is no real authority on who controls Bitcoin’s code or how it is edited. Because of this, anyone can suggest changes or upgrades to the system. If a majority of the network users agree that the new version of the code with the upgrade is sound and worthwhile, then Bitcoin can be updated.

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-134" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">
Perhaps the most profound facet of blockchain and Bitcoin is the ability for anyone, regardless of ethnicity, gender, or cultural background, to use it. According to The World Bank, an estimated 1.7 billion adults do not have bank accounts or any means of storing their money or wealth.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-35"><span>7</span></span> Nearly all of these individuals live in developing countries, where the economy is in its infancy and entirely dependent on cash.&nbsp;

These people often earn a little money that is paid in physical cash. They then need to store this physical cash in hidden locations in their homes or other places of living, leaving them subject to robbery or unnecessary violence. Keys to a bitcoin wallet can be stored on a piece of paper, a cheap cell phone, or even memorized if necessary. For most people, it is likely that these options are more easily hidden than a small pile of cash under a mattress.&nbsp;

Although blockchain can save users money on transaction fees, the technology is far from free. For example, the PoW system which the bitcoin network uses to validate transactions, consumes vast amounts of computational power. In the real world, the power from the millions of computers on the bitcoin network is close to what Norway and Ukraine consume annually.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-48"><span>8</span></span>

Despite the costs of mining bitcoin, users continue to drive up their electricity bills to validate transactions on the blockchain. That’s because when <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-does-bitcoin-mining-work/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">miners</a> add a block to the bitcoin blockchain, they are rewarded with enough bitcoin to make their time and energy worthwhile.

Bitcoin is a perfect case study for the possible inefficiencies of blockchain. Bitcoin’s PoW system takes about 10 minutes to add a new block to the blockchain.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-41"><span>9</span></span> At that rate, it’s estimated that the blockchain network can only manage about seven transactions per second (TPS). Although other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum perform better than bitcoin, they are still limited by blockchain.

While confidentiality on the blockchain network protects users from hacks and preserves privacy, it also allows for illegal trading and activity on the blockchain network.
