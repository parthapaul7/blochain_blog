<div class="mntl-sc-block-questionandanswer__answer"><p>A blockchain platform allows users and developers to create novel uses of an existing blockchain infrastructure. One example is <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ethereum.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Ethereum</a>, which has a native cryptocurrency known as ether (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ether-cryptocurrency.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">ETH</a>).<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-47"><span>16</span></span> But the Ethereum blockchain also allows the creation of smart contracts and programmable tokens used in <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initial-coin-offering-ico.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3">initial coin offerings (ICOs)</a>, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These are all built up around the Ethereum infrastructure and secured by nodes on the Ethereum network.</p></div>

<h2 class="mntl-sc-block-questionandanswer__question">How Many Blockchains Are There?</h2>
<div class="mntl-sc-block-questionandanswer__answer"><p>The number of live blockchains is growing every day at an ever-increasing pace. As of 2022, there are more than 10,000 active cryptocurrencies based on blockchain, with several hundred more non-cryptocurrency blockchains.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-32"><span>17</span></span></p></div>

<h2 class="mntl-sc-block-questionandanswer__question">What’s the Difference Between a Private Blockchain and a Public Blockchain?</h2>
<div class="mntl-sc-block-questionandanswer__answer"><p>A public blockchain, also known as an open or permissionless blockchain, is one where anybody can join the network freely and establish a node. Because of its open nature, these blockchains must be secured with cryptography and a consensus system like proof of work (PoW).</p><p>A private or permissioned blockchain, on the other hand, requires each node to be approved before joining. Because nodes are considered to be trusted, the layers of security do not need to be as robust.</p></div>

<h2 class="mntl-sc-block-questionandanswer__question">Who Invented Blockchain?</h2>
<div class="mntl-sc-block-questionandanswer__answer"><p>Blockchain technology was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, two mathematicians who wanted to implement a system where document time stamps could not be tampered with.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-36"><span>1</span></span> In the late 1990s, cypherpunk <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/three-people-who-were-supposedly-bitcoin-founder-satoshi-nakamoto/#nick-szabo" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Nick Szabo</a> proposed using a blockchain to secure a digital payments system, known as <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bit-gold.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">bit gold</a> (which was never implemented).<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-46"><span>18</span></span></p></div>

<h2 class="mntl-sc-block-questionandanswer__question">What’s Next for Blockchain?</h2>
<div class="mntl-sc-block-questionandanswer__answer"><p>With many practical applications for the technology already being implemented and explored, blockchain is finally making a name for itself in no small part because of bitcoin and cryptocurrency. As a buzzword on the tongue of every investor in the nation, blockchain stands to make business and government operations more accurate, efficient, secure, and cheap, with fewer middlemen.</p><p>As we prepare to head into the third decade of blockchain, it’s no longer a question of if legacy companies will catch on to the technology—it’s a question of when. Today, we see a proliferation of NFTs and the tokenization of assets. The next decades will prove to be an important period of growth for blockchain.</p></div>
