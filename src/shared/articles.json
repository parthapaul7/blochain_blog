As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/b\/bitcoin.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"0\">Bitcoin<\/a>, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions.

Blocks have certain storage capacities and, when filled, are closed and linked to the previously filled block, forming a chain of data known as the blockchain. All new information that follows that freshly added block is compiled into a newly formed block that will then also be added to the chain once filled.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_0-0-4\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"><\/div>\r\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_0-0-5\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\">\r\nA database usually structures its data into tables, whereas a blockchain, like its name implies, structures its data into chunks (blocks) that are strung together. This data structure inherently makes an irreversible time line of data when implemented in a decentralized nature. When a block is filled, it is set in stone and becomes a part of this time line. Each block in the chain is given an exact time stamp when it is added to the chain.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_0-0-6\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"><\/div>\r\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_0-0-7\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-callout mntl-block\">\r\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_0-0-8\" class=\"comp theme-whatyouneedtoknow mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-callout mntl-block\" data-tracking-id=\"mntl-sc-block-callout\" data-tracking-container=\"true\">\r\n<h2 id=\"mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block\">\r\nKey Takeaways<\/h2>\r\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block-callout-body_0-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block\">\r\n<ul><li>Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way that it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks that are then linked together via cryptography.<\/li><li>As new data comes in, it is entered into a fresh block.

The food industry has seen countless outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella, and listeria, as well as hazardous materials being accidentally introduced to foods. In the past, it has taken weeks to find the source of these outbreaks or the cause of sickness from what people are eating. Using blockchain gives brands the ability to track a food product\u2019s route from its origin, through each stop it makes, and finally, its delivery. If a food is found to be contaminated, then it can be traced all the way back through each stop to its origin. Not only that, but these companies can also now see everything else it may have come in contact with, allowing the identification of the problem to occur far sooner and potentially saving lives.

Financial institutions only operate during business hours, usually five days a week. That means if you try to deposit a check on Friday at 6 p.m., you will likely have to wait until Monday morning to see that money hit your account. Even if you do make your deposit during business hours, the transaction can still take one to three days to verify due to the sheer volume of transactions that banks need to settle. Blockchain, on the other hand, never sleeps.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-68\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"><\/div>\r\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-69\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\">\r\nBy integrating blockchain into banks, consumers can see their transactions processed in as little as 10 minutes\u2014basically the time it takes to add a block to the blockchain, regardless of holidays or the time of day or week. With blockchain, banks also have the opportunity to exchange funds between institutions more quickly and securely. In the stock trading business, for example, the settlement and clearing process can take up to three days (or longer, if trading internationally), meaning that the money and shares are frozen for that period of time.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-70\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"><\/div>\r\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-71\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\">\r\nGiven the size of the sums involved, even the few days that the money is in transit can carry significant costs and risks for banks.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-72\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"><\/div>\r\n<h3 id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-73\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading\"> <span class=\"mntl-sc-block-subheading__text\"> Currency <\/span> <\/h3>\r\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-74\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\">\r\nBlockchain forms the bedrock for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

If the client\u2019s bank collapses or the client lives in a country with an unstable government, the value of their currency may be at risk.

If the landlord doesn\u2019t supply the door code by the lease date, then the smart contract refunds the security deposit. This would eliminate the fees and processes typically associated with the use of a notary, a third-party mediator, or attorneys.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-94\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"><\/div>\r\n<h3 id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-95\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading\"> <span class=\"mntl-sc-block-subheading__text\"> Supply Chains <\/span> <\/h3>\r\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-96\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\">\r\nAs in the IBM Food Trust example, suppliers can use blockchain to record the origins of materials that they have purchased.

Even if a computer on the network were to make a computational mistake, the error would only be made to one copy of the blockchain.

Blockchain eliminates the need for third-party verification\u2014and, with it, their associated costs. For example, business owners incur a small fee whenever they accept payments using credit cards, because banks and payment-processing companies&nbsp;have to process those transactions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not have a central authority and has limited transaction fees.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-115\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"><\/div>\r\n<h3 id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-116\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading\"> <span class=\"mntl-sc-block-subheading__text\"> Decentralization <\/span> <\/h3>\r\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-117\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\">\r\nBlockchain does not store any of its information in a central location. Instead, the blockchain is copied and spread across a network of computers. Whenever a new block is added to the blockchain, every computer on the network updates its blockchain to reflect the change. By spreading that information across a network, rather than storing it in one central database, blockchain becomes more difficult to tamper with. If a copy of the blockchain fell into the hands of a hacker, only a single copy of the information, rather than the entire network, would be compromised.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-118\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"><\/div>\r\n<h3 id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-119\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading\"> <span class=\"mntl-sc-block-subheading__text\"> Efficient Transactions <\/span> <\/h3>\r\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-120\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\">\r\nTransactions placed through a central authority can take up to a few days to settle. If you attempt to deposit a check on Friday evening, for example, you may not actually see funds in your account until Monday morning. Whereas financial institutions operate during business hours, usually five days a week, blockchain is working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year. Transactions can be completed in as little as 10 minutes and can be considered secure after just a few hours. This is particularly useful for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/forex\/09\/currency-cross-triangulation.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">cross-border<\/a> trades, which usually take much longer because of time zone issues and the fact that all parties must confirm payment processing.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-121\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"><\/div>\r\n<h3 id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-122\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading\"> <span class=\"mntl-sc-block-subheading__text\"> Private Transactions <\/span> <\/h3>\r\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-123\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\">\r\nMany blockchain networks operate as public databases, meaning that anyone with an Internet connection can view a list of the network\u2019s transaction history. Although users can access details about transactions, they cannot access identifying information about the users making those transactions. It is a common misperception that blockchain networks like bitcoin are anonymous, when in fact they are only confidential.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-124\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"><\/div>\r\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-125\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\">\r\nWhen a user makes a public transaction, their unique code\u2014called a public key, as mentioned earlier\u2014is recorded on the blockchain. Their personal information is not. If a person has made a Bitcoin purchase on an exchange that requires identification, then the person\u2019s identity is still linked to their blockchain address\u2014but a transaction, even when tied to a person\u2019s name, does not reveal any personal information.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-126\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"><\/div>\r\n<h3 id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-127\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading\"> <span class=\"mntl-sc-block-subheading__text\"> Secure Transactions <\/span> <\/h3>\r\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-128\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\">\r\nOnce a transaction is recorded, its authenticity must be verified by the blockchain network. Thousands of computers on the blockchain rush to confirm that the details of the purchase are correct. After a computer has validated the transaction, it is added to the blockchain block. Each block on the blockchain contains its own unique hash, along with the unique hash of the block before it. When the information on a block is edited in any way, that block\u2019s hash code changes\u2014however, the hash code on the block after it would not. This discrepancy makes it extremely difficult for information on the blockchain to be changed without notice.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-129\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"><\/div>\r\n<h3 id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-130\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading\"> <span class=\"mntl-sc-block-subheading__text\"> Transparency <\/span> <\/h3>\r\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-131\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\">\r\nMost blockchains are entirely open-source software. This means that anyone and everyone can view its code. This gives auditors the ability to review cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for security. This also means that there is no real authority on who controls Bitcoin\u2019s code or how it is edited. Because of this, anyone can suggest changes or upgrades to the system. If a majority of the network users agree that the new version of the code with the upgrade is sound and worthwhile, then Bitcoin can be updated.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-132\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"><\/div>\r\n<h3 id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-133\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading\"> <span class=\"mntl-sc-block-subheading__text\"> Banking the Unbanked <\/span> <\/h3>\r\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-134\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\">\r\nPerhaps the most profound facet of blockchain and Bitcoin is the ability for anyone, regardless of ethnicity, gender, or cultural background, to use it. According to The World Bank, an estimated 1.7 billion adults do not have bank accounts or any means of storing their money or wealth.<span class=\"mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger\" data-id=\"#citation-35\"><span>7<\/span><\/span> Nearly all of these individuals live in developing countries, where the economy is in its infancy and entirely dependent on cash.&nbsp;\r\n<\/p>\r\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-135\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"><\/div>\r\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-136\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\">\r\nThese people often earn a little money that is paid in physical cash. They then need to store this physical cash in hidden locations in their homes or other places of living, leaving them subject to robbery or unnecessary violence. Keys to a bitcoin wallet can be stored on a piece of paper, a cheap cell phone, or even memorized if necessary. For most people, it is likely that these options are more easily hidden than a small pile of cash under a mattress.&nbsp;\r\n<\/p>\r\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-137\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"><\/div>\r\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-138\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\">\r\nBlockchains of the future are also looking for solutions to not only be a unit of account for wealth storage but also to store medical records, property rights, and a variety of other legal contracts.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-139\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"><\/div>\r\n<span class=\"heading-toc\" id=\"toc-drawbacks-of-blockchains\"><\/span>",
